<p><tt>Henry Gally's <i>A Critical Essay on Characteristic-Writings</i>,
here reprinted, is the introductory essay to his translation of <i>The
Moral Characters of Theophrastus</i> (1725). Of Gally's life (1696-1769)
little is known. Apparently his was a moderately successful
ecclesiastical career: he was appointed in 1735 chaplain-in-ordinary to
George II. His other published works consist of sermons, religious
tracts, and an undistinguished treatise on the pronunciation of Greek.</tt></p>

<p><tt>His essay on the character, however, deserves attention because it is the
first detailed and serious discussion by an Englishman of a literary kind
immensely popular in its day. English writers before Gally had, of course,
commented on the character. Overbury, for example, in "What A Character Is"
(<i>Sir Thomas Overbury His Wife...</i> 1616) had defined the character as
"wit's descant on any plain-song," and Brathwaite in his Dedication to
<i>Whimzies</i>(1631) had written that character-writers must shun affectation
and prefer the "pith before the rind." Wye Saltonstall in the same year in his
Dedicatory Epistle to <i>Picturae Loquentes</i>
had required of a character
"lively and exact Lineaments" and "fast and loose knots which the ingenious
Reader may easily untie." These remarks, however, as also Flecknoe's "Of the
Author's Idea of a Character" (<i>Enigmaticall Characters</i>, 1658) and Ralph
Johnson's "rules" for character-writing in
<i>A Scholar's Guide from the Accidence to the University</i> (1665),
are fragmentary and oblique. Nor do
either of the two English translations of Theophrastus before Gally--the
one a rendering of La Bruyère's French version,<a name = "tag1"
href = "#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the other, Eustace Budgell's <i>The
Moral Characters of Theophrastus</i> (1714)--touch more than in
passing on the nature of the character. Gally's essay, in which he claims
to deduce his critical principles from the practice of Theophrastus,
<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
is both historically and intrinsically the most important work of its kind.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Section I of Gally's essay, thoroughly
conventional in nature, is omitted
here. In it Gally, following Casaubon,<a name = "tag2"
href = "#note2"><sup>2</sup></a> theorizes that the character evolved
out of Greek Old Comedy. The Augustans saw a close connection between drama and
character-writing. Congreve (Dedication to <i>The</i>
<i>Way of the World</i>, 1700)
thought that the comic dramatist Menander formed his characters on "the
observations of Theophrastus, of whom he was a disciple," and Budgell, who
termed Theophrastus the father of modern comedy, believed that if some of
Theophrastus's characters "were well worked up, and brought upon the British
theatre, they could not fail of Success."<a name = "tag3"
href = "#note3"><sup>3</sup></a> Gally similarly held that a
dramatic character and Theophrastan character differ only in</tt></p>

<blockquote><tt>
the different Manner of representing the same Image. The <i>Drama</i> presents
to the Eyes of a Spectator an Actor, who speaks and acts as the Person, whom he
represents, is suppos'd to speak and act in real Life.
The <i>Characteristic</i>
Writer introduces, in a descriptive manner, before a Reader, the same Person, as
speaking and acting in the same manner.
</tt></blockquote>

<p><tt>Section III of Gally's essay, like Section I thoroughly conventional, is
also omitted here. Gally attributes to Theophrastus the spurious "Proem," in
which Theophrastus, emphasizing his ethical purpose, announces his intention of
following up his characters of vice with characters of virtue. At one point
Gally asserts that Theophrastus taught the same doctrine as Aristotle and Plato,
but</tt></p>

<blockquote><tt>
accommodated Morality to the Taste of the
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
<i>Beau Monde</i>, with all the Embellishments that can
please the nice Ears of
an intelligent Reader, and with that inoffensive Satir,
which corrects the Vices
of Men, without making them conceive any Aversion for the Satirist.
</tt></blockquote>

<p><tt>It is Gally's concept of the character as an art-form, however, which is
most interesting to the modern scholar. Gally breaks sharply with earlier
character-writers like Overbury who, he thinks, have departed from the
Theophrastan method. Their work for the most part reflects corrupted
taste:</tt></p>

<blockquote><tt>
A continued Affectation of far-fetched and quaint Simile's, which runs thro'
almost all these Characters, makes 'em appear like so many Pieces of mere
Grotesque; and the Reader must not expect to find Persons describ'd as they
really are, but rather according to what they are thought to be
like.
</tt></blockquote>

<p><tt>And Gally attacks one of the favorite devices of the seventeenth-century
character:</tt></p>

<blockquote><tt>
An Author, in this Kind, must not dwell too long upon one Idea; As soon as the
masterly Stroke is given, he must immediately pass on to another Idea.... For
if, after the masterly Stroke is given, the Author shou'd, in a paraphrastical
Manner, still insist upon the same Idea, the Work will immediately flag, the
Character grow languid, and the Person characteris'd will insensibly vanish from
the Eyes of the Reader.
</tt></blockquote>

<p><tt>One has only to read a character like Butler's "A Flatterer" to
appreciate Gally's point. The Theophrastan
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
method had been to describe a character operatively--that is, through the
use of concrete dramatic incident illustrating the particular vice. The
seventeenth-century character is too often merely a showcase for the writer's
wit. One frequently finds a succession of ingenious metaphors, each redefining
from a slightly different angle a type's master-passion, but blurring rather
than sharpening the likeness.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Gally insists that the style of the character be plain and easy, "without
any of those Points and Turns, which convey to the Mind nothing but a low and
false Wit." The piece should not be tediously rambling, but compact. It must
have perfect unity of structure: each sentence should add a significant detail
to the portrait. The manner ought to be lively, the language pure and
unaffected.</tt></p>

<p><tt>As for the character-writer's materials, they are "Human Nature, in its
various Forms and Affections." Each character should focus on a single vice or
virtue, yet since "the Heart of Man is frequently actuated by more Passions than
one," subsidiary traits ought to be included to round out the portrait (e.g.,
the covetous man may also be impudent, the impudent man generous). Budgell had
expressed a similar conception. A character, he wrote, "may be compared to a
Looking-glass that is placed to catch a particular Object; but cannot represent
that Object in its full Light, without giving us a little Landskip of every
thing else that lies about it."<a name = "tag4"
href = "#note4"><sup>4</sup></a> By Gally's time writers like Pascal, La
Rochefoucauld, and La Bruyère had done much to show the complex and paradoxical
nature of human behaviour. Gally, who praises La Rochefoucauld as the one modern
as well equipped as Theophrastus to compose characters, reacts with his age
against the stale types which both comedy and the character had been retailing
<i>ad nauseam</i>. Human nature, says Gally, is full of
subtle shadings and agreeable variations which the
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
character ought to exploit. He quotes Temple to the effect that England is
richer than any other nation in "original Humours" and wonders that no one has
yet attempted a comprehensive portrait-gallery of English personality. Those
writers who have come closest to Gally's idea of how "humour" ought to be
handled are the "great Authors" of the <i>Tatlers</i> and <i>Spectators</i>,
with their "interspers'd Characters of Men and Manners compleatly drawn to the
Life."</tt></p>

<p><tt>In admiring the Roger de Coverley sketches, Gally typifies the
increasingly tolerant attitude of the Augustans toward eccentric
behavior.<a name = "tag5" href = "#note5"><sup>5</sup></a>
Like Sterne and Fielding he is delighted by people whose idiosyncracies are
harmless and appealing. As for the harsh satiric animus of a character-writer
like Butler, it is totally alien to Gally, who would chide good-naturedly, so as
"not to seem to make any Attacks upon the Province of Self-Love" in the reader.
"Each Man," he writes, "contains a little World within himself, and every Heart
is a new World." The writer should understand and appreciate, not ridicule, an
individual's uniqueness.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Of course, the character as Theophrastus wrote it described the type, not
the particular person. Gally, who sets up Theophrastus as his model, apparently
fails to realize that a "humourist" like Sir Roger verges on individuality.
Indeed, while discussing the need for writers to study their own and other men's
passions, he emphasizes that "without a Knowledge of these Things, 'twill be
impossible ever to draw a Character so to the Life, as that it shall hit one
Person, and him only." Here Gally might well be talking of the Clarendon kind of
portrait. If a character is "one Person, and him only," he is no longer a type,
but somebody peculiarly himself.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Gally, then, is not as Theophrastan as he professes
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
to be. True, he harks back to Theophrastus in matters of style and technique.
And he does not criticize him, as does La Bruyère,<a name = "tag6"
href = "#note6"><sup>6</sup></a> for paying too much
attention to a man's external actions, and not enough to his "Thoughts,
Sentiments, and Inclinations." Nevertheless his mind is receptive to the kind of
individuated characterization soon to distinguish the mid-eighteenth century
novel. The type is still his measuring-stick, but he calibrates it far less
rigidly than a Rymer analyzing Iago or Evadne. A man can be A Flatterer or A
Blunt Man and still retain a private identity: this private identity Gally
recognizes as important. Gally's essay thus reflects fundamental changes in the
English attitude toward human nature and its literary representation.</tt></p>

<p><span class = "firstletter">T</span><i>HE following Papers, which I now
commit to the Public, have lain by me unregarded these many Years. They were
first undertaken at the Request of a Person, who at present shall be nameless.
Since that Time I have been wholly diverted from Studies of this Nature, and my
Thoughts have been employed about Subjects of a much greater Consequence, and
more agreeable to my Profession: Insomuch, that I had nothing in my Mind less
than the Publication of these Papers; but some Friends, who had perus'd them,
were of Opinion, that
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
they deserv'd to be publish'd, and that they might afford an agreeable
Entertainment not without some Profit to the Reader. </i>These<i> Motives
prevailed upon me to give </i>them<i> a second Care, and to bestow upon them so
much Pains, as was necessary to put them in that State, in which they now
appear.</i></p>

<p><i>The first Piece that the Reader will meet with is</i>, A Critical <span
class = "smallcaps">Essay</span> on Characteristic-Writings: <i>It treats of the
Origin of those Writings: It points out the general Laws to be observ'd in such
Compositions, and it contains some Reflexions on </i>Theophrastus's<i> and
Mr.</i> de la Bruyere's <i>Performances in this Way. The Design of this at least
is, I think, new. Mr. </i>Fabricius<i> mentions a <a name = "tagA" href =
"#noteA"><sup>A</sup></a>Book, which, by its Title, shou'd bear some Relation to
this Essay, but tho' I have enquir'd after it pretty strictly, yet I never cou'd
get a Sight of it, nor have I conversed with any Person that had perus'd
it.</i></p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
<i>The next Piece is a Translation of the </i>Moral Characters of
Theophrastus<i> from the </i>Greek<i>. This is not the first Time that
</i>Theophrastus<i> has appeared in a modern Dress. Mr. </i>de la Bruyere<i>
translated him into </i>French<i>: And this was the Foundation of those
Characters, which he himself compos'd, and which gave Rise to those many
Performances, that were afterwards attempted in the same Way. <a name = "tagB"
href = "#noteB"><sup>B</sup></a>Mr. </i>Menage<i> has highly extoll'd this
Translation. </i>Elle est<i>, says he, </i>bien belle, &amp; bien françoise,
&amp; montre que son Auteur entend parfaitement le Grec. Je puis dire que j'y ay
vu des Choses, que, peut etre, Faute d'Attention, je n'avois pas vues dans le
Grec.<i> This is great; and it must be own'd that Mr. </i>Menage<i> was a Man of
very extensive Learning, and a great Master of the </i>Greek<i> Tongue; but that
his Judgment was always equal to his <ins class = "correction"
title = "spelling as in original">Knowledg</ins> of Words,
will not be so readily allow'd. Besides, the Credit of the</i>
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
<i>Books ending in </i>ana<i> runs very low, and in particular the
</i>Menagiana<i> have been disown'd by Mr. </i>Menage's<i> own <a name = "tagC"
href = "#noteC"><sup>C</sup></a>Relations, as being injurious to the Merit and
Memory of that great Man. And therefore it must still be left to the inquisitive
and judicious Reader to determine, whether those Faults, which I have observ'd
in Mr. </i>de la Bruyere'<i>s Translation are justly censur'd or
not.</i></p>

<p><i>The </i>Characters<i> of </i>Theophrastus<i> have been twice translated
into </i>English<i>. The former Translation is </i>anonymous<i>, and the latter
was done by the ingenious Mr. </i>Eustace Budgell<i>. It will be expected that I
shou'd say something of these two Translations. And I shall be the more ready to
do this, because I shall hereby insensibly lead the Reader to the Reasons which
induc'd me to undertake a third.</i></p>

<p><i>The anonymous </i>English<i> Translation <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'is sa d to'">is said to</ins> have been done upon the
</i>Greek<i>. But this is only a Pretence, and a low Artifice of the
ignorant</i>
<span class = "pagenum">xvii</span>
<span class = "folionum">a</span>
<i>Translator: For in reality 'tis no more than a mean and insipid Translation
of the </i>French<i> of Mr. </i>de la Bruyere<i>, revis'd upon the </i>Latin<i>
of </i>Casaubon<i>, which answers almost verbally to the Original </i>Greek<i>.
If this were a Matter of Importance, I wou'd here fully demonstrate it: For the
Fact is so glaring, that tho' the Translator is wholly unknown to me, yet I can
aver what I have asserted to be Truth, almost as certainly, as if I had been an
Eye Witness to the doing of it</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. </i>Budgell<i>'s Translation must be own'd to be polite: But
politeness is not the only Qualification that is required in such a Translation.
The learn'd Reader, who understands the Original, will consider it in a
different View. And to <ins class = "correction"
title = "spelling as in original">judg</ins> of it according
to those Rules which Translators ought to
observe, it must be condemned. In general, it is not exact and accurate enough;
but what is far worse, Mr. </i>Budgell<i> gives, in too many Instances, his own
Thoughts instead of representing the true Sense of </i>Theophrastus<i>. This is
perverting the </i>Humour<i> of the Original, and, in Effect, making
a</i>
<span class = "pagenum">xviii</span>
<i>new Work, instead of giving only a Translation. Mr. </i>Budgell<i>
ingenuously confesses, that he has taken a great deal of Liberty; but when a
Translator confesses thus much, it does but give the Reader good Reason to
suspect that instead of taking a great deal, he has in reality taken too
much</i>.</p>

<p><i>Antient Authors (when they are translated) suffer in nothing more, than in
having the Manners and Customs, to which they allude, transformed into the
Manners and Customs of the present Age. By this Liberty, or rather
Licenciousness of Translators, Authors not only appear in a different Dress, but
they become unlike themselves, by losing that peculiar and distinctive Character
in which they excel. This is most palpable in those Authors, whose Character
consists in </i>Humour<i>. Let any one read </i>Terence<i>, as he is translated
by Mr. </i>Echard<i>, and he will take him to have been a Buffoon: Whereas
</i>Terence<i> never dealt in such a Kind of low Mirth. His true Character is,
to have afforded to his Spectators and Readers the gravest,</i>
<span class = "pagenum">xix</span>
<span class = "folionum">a2</span>
<i>and, at the same Time, the most agreeable, most polite Entertainment of any
antient Author now extant. This is, in some Measure, the Case of
</i>Theophrastus:<i> He has been transformed; and he has suffer'd in the
Transformation. What I have endeavoured is, to do him that Justice which, I
think, he has not hitherto met with, by preserving the native Simplicity of his
Characters, by retaining those antient Manners and Customs which he alludes to,
and keeping up the peculiar </i>Humour<i> of the Original as nearly, as the
Difference of Language wou'd allow. This is the Attempt; how far I have
succeeded, must be let to the judicious and curious Reader to determine. Thus
much I thought necessary to say concerning former Translations, in order to
justify my own Undertaking, which will not acquire an intrinsic Merit from the
Censures, that I have pass'd upon others. No: The Faults of others cannot
extenuate our own; and that Stamp, which every Work carries along with it, can
only determine of what Kind it really is.</i></p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">xx</span>
<i>The Reader will expect that I shou'd here say a Word or two concerning the
</i>Notes<i> which follow the </i>Characters<i>. Some Authors or Commentators
(call them which you will) out of a vain Ostentation of Literature, lay hold of
the slightest of Opportunities to expose all their Learning to the World,
without ever knowing when they have said enough: Insomuch, that in most
Commentaries upon antient Authors, one may sooner meet with a System of
Antiquities, than with Solutions of the real Difficulties of the Text.
Consider'd barely as a Translator, I lay under no immediate Necessity of writing
</i>Notes<i>, but then as I was highly concern'd, even in that Capacity, to lay
before the </i>English<i> Reader, what I took to be the true Sense of the
</i>Greek<i>, and as I farther propos'd to preserve that particular
</i>Humour<i> of the Original, which depends on those Manners and Customs which
are alluded to, I found, my self necessitated to add some </i>Notes<i>; but yet
I have endeavoured to shun that Fault, which I have already censur'd, by
saying</i>
<span class = "pagenum">xxi</span>
<i>no more, but what was immediately necessary, to illustrate the Text, to
vindicate a received Sense, or to propose a new one.</i></p>

<p><i>I am not conscious of having made any great Excursions beyond the Bounds
which these Rules prescrib'd to me, unless it is in the Chapter concerning
</i>Superstition<i>. And even here, unless the Commentary had been somewhat
copious, the Text it self wou'd have appear'd like a motly Piece of mysterious
Nonsense. Thus much I thought my self oblig'd to do in Justice to
</i>Theophrastus<i>; and as for the Enlargements which I have made, over and
above what wou'd have satisfy'd this Demand, they will not, 'tis hop'd, be
unacceptable to the curious Reader. They are Digressions I own; but I shall not
here offer to make one Digression to execute another, or, according to the
Custom and Practice of modern Authors, beg a thousand Pardons of the Reader,
before I am certain of having committed one Offence. Such a Procedure seems
preposterous. For when an Author happens to digress, and take</i>
<span class = "pagenum">xxii</span>
<i>a Trip <span class = "greek">huper ta eskammena</span>, beyond the Bounds
prescrib'd; the best, the only consistent thing he can do, is to take his Chance
for the Event. If what he has said does not immediately relate to the Matter in
Hand, it may nevertheless be </i>a propos<i>, and good in its Kind; and then
instead of Censure, he will probably meet with Thanks; but if it be not good, no
prefatory Excuses will make it so: And besides, it will ever be insisted on,
that 'tis an easier Matter to strike out bad Digressions, than it is to write
good Apologies.</i></p>

<p><i>One Word more, and then I have done. Since Mr. </i>Budgell<i> has thought
fit to censure Mr. </i>de la Bruyere<i>, for troubling his Reader with
</i>Notes<i>, I think my self oblig'd, in order to justify both Mr. </i>de la
Bruyere<i> and my self, to shew that this Censure is very unreasonable, and very
unjust.<a name = "tagD" href = "#noteD"><sup>D</sup></a> Mr. </i>Budgell's<i>
Words are as follow. Theophrastus</i>, at the Time he writ, referr'd to
nothing but what was well known to the meanest Person in <i>Athens</i>; but as
Mr. <i>Bruyere</i>
<span class = "pagenum">xxiii</span>
has manag'd it, by hinting at too many <i>Grecian</i> Customs, a modern Reader
is oblig'd to peruse one or two <i>Notes</i>, which are frequently longer than
the Sentence it self he wou'd know the meaning of. <i>But if those Manners and
Customs, which </i>Theophrastus<i> alludes to, were, in his Time, well known to
the meanest </i>Athenian<i>, it does not follow that they are now so well known
to a modern Reader</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. </i>de la Bruyere's<i> Fault does not consist in having put
</i>Notes<i> to his Translation, but rather in not having put enough. When a
Translator of an antient Author intends to preserve the peculiar Character of
the Original, </i>Notes<i> become absolutely necessary to render the Translation
intelligible to a modern Reader. The Learn'd may pass them over; and those, for
whom </i>Explanatory Notes<i> are chiefly designed, must not think it too much
Trouble, to bestow a second Reading on the Text, after they have given a First
to the Whole. This Trouble (if any thing ought to be call'd so that
conveys</i>
<span class = "pagenum">xxiv</span>
<i>Instruction) is no more than what many persons, who have attained to no small
share of <ins class = "correction"
title = "spelling as in original">Knowledg</ins>
in the learn'd Languages, must submit to, at the first Perusal of an Original
Author. If in a translated Author any Difficulties occur, on this Head, to a
modern Reader, and the Translator has taken Care to clear up those difficulties
by adding </i>Notes<i>, the modern Reader ought to thank him for his Pains, and
not think his Labour superfluous.</i></p>

<p><i>'Tis hop'd then that the </i>Notes<i>, that I have added, will be kindly
receiv'd. The Reader will nevertheless be at full Liberty to peruse them, or to
pass them over. If he if but so favourable as to approve of the Translation it
self, this will be a sufficient Satisfaction to the Translator, and be looked
upon as no finall Commendation of the Performance. For a Translation, if it be
well performed, ought in Justice to be receiv'd as a good Commentary</i>.</p>

<h3><a name = "sec_ii">SECT. II.</a></h3>

<p>There is no Kind of polite Writing that seems to require a deeper Knowledge,
a livelier Imagination, and a happier Turn of Expression than the
Characteristic. Human Nature, in its various Forms and Affections, is the
Subject; and he who wou'd attempt a Work of this Kind, with some assurance of
Success, must not only study other Men; he has a more difficult Task to perform;
he must study himself. The deep and dark Recesses of the Heart must be
penetrated, to discover how Nature is disguis'd into Art, and how Art puts on
the Appearance of Nature.&mdash;This Knowledge is great; 'tis the Perfection of
Moral Philosophy; 'tis an inestimable Treasure: But yet if it shou'd fall into
the Hands of one, who wants proper Abilities to communicate his
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
Knowledge to the World, it wou'd be of no Service but to the Owner: It wou'd
make him, indeed, an able Philosopher, but not an able Writer of
Characters.</p>

<p>The Mind has its peculiar Features as well as the Body; and these must be
represented in their genuine and native Colours, that so the Picture may strike,
and every Reader, who is concern'd in the Work, may presently discover himself;
and those, who are unconcern'd may, nevertheless, immediately perceive a just
Correspondence between that Piece and Nature.</p>

<p>Every Action has its proper Thought, and every Thought its proper Expression.
And these Correspondences are not imaginary, but have a real Foundation in
Nature: For when any one of these is wanting, the whole is lame and defective,
but when they all meet and conspire together, the Character is then genuine and
compleat, the Thing or Person design'd is drawn to the Life, and the Reader is
left uncertain, whether the Character, that lies before him, is an Effect of
Art,
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
or a real Appearance of Nature.&mdash;A Master-Piece of this Kind, requires the
Hand of one who is a Critic in Men and Manners, a Critic in Thoughts, and a
Critic in Language.</p>

<p>A superficial Knowledge of human Nature, will never qualify a Man to be a
Writer of Characters. He must be a Master of the Science; and be able to lead a
Reader, knowingly, thro' that Labyrinth of the Passions, which fill the Heart of
Man, and make him either a noble or a despicable Creature. For tho' some, who
have never attempted any thing of this kind, may think it an easy Matter to
write two or three Pages of Morality with Spirit, to describe an Action, a
Passion, a Manner; yet had they made the Experiment, the Event wou'd not have
answer'd their Expectation, and they wou'd have found, that this easy Work was
more difficult than they, at first, imagin'd.</p>

<p>The Features of every single Passion must be known; the Relation which that
Passion bears to another, must be discover'd; and the Harmony and
Discord
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
which result from them must be felt. Many have studied these Things, but few
have thoroughly understood them. The Labour is vast; 'tis almost infinite; and
yet without a Knowledge of these Things, 'twill be impossible ever to draw a
Character so to the Life, as that it shall hit one Person, and him
only.</p>

<p>We have all of us different Souls, and our Souls have Affections as different
from one another, as our outward Faces are in their Lineaments. Each Man
contains a little World within himself, and every Heart is a new World. We
cannot therefore attain to a perfect Knowledge of human Nature, by studying
others or our selves alone, but by studying both. 'Tis this Knowledge which sets
the Philosopher above the Peasant, and gives the Preference to one Author above
another. This Knowledge has a Force, something like to that of Magic Charms: by
the help of it one, who is Master of the Science, can turn Men inside outwards,
and expose them to the Eyes of the World, as they really are, and not as they
wou'd fain appear to be. By the
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<span class = "folionum">D</span>
help of this Knowledge an intelligent Writer can form to his Reader the most
agreeable, most instructive Entertainment that can possibly be desir'd;
transport him, with the greatest Ease imaginable, from the Solitude of his
Chamber to Places of the greatest Concourse; there to see and learn the Virtues
of Men; there to see and shun their Vices, without any danger of being corrupted
by the Contagion of a real Commerce.</p>

<p>How absolutely necessary a thorough Insight into the Heart and Passions of
Man is to a Writer of Characters, will be more evident by descending to some
Particulars, and pointing out some of those nice Circumstances, which a Writer
of Characters must accurately observe, and by which his Capacity in this Way may
be easily judg'd of.</p>

<p>It must be observ'd then, that the Heart of Man is frequently actuated by
more Passions than one: And as the same Object does, by its different Position,
afford to the Spectator different Representations, so does the same Affection of
the Mind, by exerting it self after a different
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
manner, lay a real Foundation for so many distinct Characters. The under
Passions may, by their various Operations, cause some Diversity in the Colour
and Complexion of the Whole, but 'tis the Master-Passion which must determine
the Character.</p>

<p>Since therefore the under Parts of a Character are not essential, they may or
may not be reciprocal. A covetous Man may be impudent, or he may have some share
of Modesty left: On the other Hand, an impudent Man may be generous, or his
Character may be stain'd by Avarice. And therefore to make the Features of one
Virtue or Vice enter, as under Parts, into the Character of another Virtue or
Vice, is so far from being a Transgression of the Nature of Things, that, on the
contrary, all the Beauty of <i>Characteristic-Writing</i>, and all the Beauty
which arises from the Variety of an agreeable Mixture, entirely depends on
<i>this</i>. The main Difficulty consists in making the Master-Passion operate
so conspicuously throughout the Whole, as that the
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<span class = "folionum">D2</span>
Reader may, in every step of the Performance, immediately discover
it.</p>

<p>The Truth of it is, that there are some Affections of the Mind, which not
only constitute of themselves a distinct Virtue or Vice, but are also the
Foundation of many others. Avarice is of this extensive Nature; it constitutes,
of it self, a distinct Character, and it enters into the Competition of several
others. St. <i>Paul</i> says, that <i>the love of money is the root of all
evil</i>; which Maxim the spurious <i>Phocylides</i> has express'd in the
following Verse,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<span class = "greek">Hê philochrêmosunê mêtêr kakotêtos hapasês.</span>
</div>

<p>This Doctrine may be made yet more sensible by applying it to the Practice of
<i>Theophrastus</i>, whose Conduct, in this Respect, ought to be look'd upon as
an authentick Pattern. Rusticity, Avarice and Impudence, are in their own Nature
distinct Vices, but yet there is a very near Relation between them, which has a
real Foundation in the Actions of Men. And, as on the one Hand,
<i>Theophrastus</i>
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
has drawn distinct Characters of these Vices, so, on the other Hand, he has made
the peculiar Features of one or more of these Vices enter into the Characters of
the other. This is Matter of Fact; and if the Reader will be at the Pains to
compare the <i>6th</i>, <i>9th</i>, and <i>11th</i>, Chapters, as he will be
perswaded of the Truth of what is here asserted, so will he be convinc'd, at the
same Time, that <i>Theophrastus</i> has not confounded by this Mixture the real
Nature of Things, or transgress'd thereby, in any wise, the Rules of
<i>Characteristic-Justice</i>.</p>

<p>Again; Loquacity and an ill-tim'd Behaviour are two very different Vices in
common Conversation; but yet <i>Theophrastus</i> has concluded his Character of
Loquacity, with the same Stroke which begins that of an ill-tim'd Behaviour;
because tho' these Vices are of a different Nature, yet do they not exclude each
other; and the Actions of Men manifestly prove, that they are frequently to be
found in the same Subject.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<span class = "folionum">D3</span>
The nice Reader therefore, instead of being offended to find the peculiar
Features of one Vice interspers'd in the Character of another, ought, on the
contrary, to admire the Judgment and Accuracy of <i>Theophrastus</i> in this
Respect: For this Mixture does not proceed from Inaccuracy, but is founded in
Nature: And 'tis the Work of a sagacious Head, as well to discover the near
Relations that are between different things, as to separate those Things, which
by Nature are nearly related, but yet are really distinct.</p>

<p>The Beauty of every Kind of Writing arises from the Conformity which it bears
to Nature; and therefore the Excellency of <i>Characteristic-Writings</i> must
consist in exact Representations of human Nature.&mdash;This Harmony between Art
and Nature may be call'd Justice: And tho' the Boundaries of it may be more
extensive in those Works, in which a greater Range is allow'd to the
Imagination, yet still, Invention and Fiction must be admitted in
<i>Characteristic-Writings</i>, when the Characters design'd are of a general
Nature; for then the Writer
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
does not copy from an individual Original, and all the Extravagances of Nature
are natural, when they are well represented.</p>

<p>It requires, I own, a great deal of Penetration to hit exactly this Point of
Reality: But then it must be confess'd, that as the great difficulty of
<i>Characteristic-Writing</i> consists in this, so does the main Beauty and
Force of it too: For Objects are apt to affect and move us according to their
Presence or Absence; and a Character will naturally strike us more forcibly, the
more the Images, which it consists of, are lively and natural; because the
Object is then most present to our Mind.</p>

<p>Since every Feature must be drawn exactly to the Life, great Care must be
taken, that the Strokes be not too faint, nor yet too strong: For
Characteristic-Justice is to be observ'd as strictly by the Writers of this
Kind, as Poetic-Justice is to be by Poets. That Medium must be copied, which
Nature it self has mark'd out; whatever falls short of it is poor and insipid,
whatever is above it is Rant and Extravagance.</p>

Ld. <i>Roscommon.</i>
</div>

<p>A consummate Delicacy of Sentiments, and an exquisite Judgment are the very
Soul of <i>Characteristic-Writing</i>; for every particular Stroke, as well as
the whole Character, has a proper Degree of Perfection. To attain this Point,
and to bring the several Parts, as well as the Whole, exactly to this Pitch, is
the Work of a sagacious Head, and of a perfect Judgment.&mdash;An Author, in
this Kind, must not dwell too long upon one Idea: As soon as the masterly Stroke
is given, he must immediately pass on to another Idea. This will give Life to
the Work, and serve to keep up the Spirit of the Writing, and of the Reader too:
For
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
if, after the masterly Stroke is given, the Author shou'd, in a paraphrastical
Manner, still insist upon the same Idea, the Work will immediately flag, the
Character grow languid, and the Person characteris'd will insensibly vanish from
the Eyes of the Reader.</p>

<p>An honest Writer, who has the Profit as well as the Pleasure of his Reader in
View, ought always to tell the Truth. But as he is at Liberty to chuse his
manner of telling it, so that Method of Instruction ought to be observ'd in
<i>Characteristic-Writings</i>, which will keep up the good Humour of the
Reader, altho' he is, at the same Time, made sensible of his Errors. And this
Artifice ought industriously to be pursu'd, since the proper Management of it is
so necessary to the Success of <i>Characteristic-Writings</i>. For those who
love and admire Truth themselves, must yet be sensible that 'tis generally
unwelcome, both to themselves and to others, when the Point of Self-Interest is
concern'd. And the Reason of it is, not because Truth is really ugly and
deform'd, but because it presents to our
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
View certain Inconsistencies and Errors, which Self-Love will not allow us to
condemn. And therefore the great Art and Difficulty, in making Truth pleasant
and profitable, is so to expose Error, as not to seem to make any Attacks upon
the Province of Self-Love.</p>

particularly excell'd, if we may believe his Successor and Panegyrist
<i>Pavillon</i>.</p>

<p>What is the proper Style for <i>Characteristic-Writings</i> is briefly laid
down by <a name = "tagH" href = "#noteH"><sup>H</sup></a><i>Libanius</i> in the
following Words. <span class = "greek">Ergasê tên êthopoiian charaktêri saphei,
suntomô, anthêrô, apolutô, apêllagmenô pasês plokês te kai schêmatos</span>.
"When you describe Manners you must use a plain, concise, florid, easy Style,
free from all artificial Turns and Figures." Every Thing must be even, smooth,
easy and unaffected; without any of those Points and Turns, which convey to the
Mind nothing but a low and false Wit, in which our Moderns so much abound, and
in which they seem to place their greatest Beauties.</p>

<p>The primary Standard for Style is the Nature of the Subject: And therefore,
as <i>Characteristic-Writings</i> are professed Representations of Nature, an
Author in this Way is immediately concern'd to
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
use a simple and natural Style: Nor has he any Reason to fear, that this will
any ways prejudice his Performance, and make it appear low, flat and insipid;
for in Reality there is nothing more noble than a true Simplicity, and nothing
more beautiful than Nature, when it appears in the easy Charms of its own native
Dress.</p>

<p>In <i>Characteristic-Writings</i> both the Way of Thinking and the Style must
be Laconic: Much must be contained in a little Compass. Brevity of Diction adds
new Life to a good Thought: And since every perfect Stroke ought to be a
distinct Representation of a particular Feature, Matters shou'd be so order'd,
that every perfect Sentence may contain a perfect Thought, and every perfect
Thought may represent one Feature.</p>

<p>Many other Particulars might have been observ'd and recommended to those, who
wou'd attempt a Performance in this Kind, with some Assurance of Success. The
Laws of good Writing, in general, may and ought to be applied to
<i>Characteristic-Writing</i>, in particular,
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
as far as the Nature of it will bear. But to pursue these Things accurately,
wou'd carry me beyond the Bounds which the Title of this Work prescribes to me.
To shew the peculiar Nature; to point out the principal Beauties, and to lay
down the general Laws of <i>Characteristic-Writing</i>, is all that was
propos'd. Besides, I shall have Occasion, in the Sequel of this Essay, to make
some further Observations relating to the Constitution of
<i>Characteristic-Writings</i>;
which, to prevent Repetitions, I forbear mentioning here; but if the Reader be
religious in the Observance of a strict Method, he is at full Liberty to alter
the Situation of them, and to refer them to this Section.</p>

<p><span class = "firstletter">M</span>R. <i>de la Bruyere</i> has given us a
Translation of the Characters of <i>Theophrastus</i>; to which he has annex'd
what he calls the Characters or Manners of the present Age. This Work was
receiv'd with Applause, and the Author gain'd by it a great Reputation amongst
Men of polite Literature. And if to make a great deal of Noise in the World, and
to undergo several Editions, were infallible Proofs of the intrinsick Merit of a
Book, Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i>'s Performance would, upon both these Accounts,
sufficiently recommend itself to our Approbation.&mdash;I confess, there are
very considerable Beauties in this Piece: but yet if it should be examin'd by
those Rules of Characteristic-Writing, which I have already mention'd, and which
I take to be essential
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
to Performances in this Kind, I am afraid it would not be able, in every
Respect, to stand the Test of an impartial Examination.</p>
<p>I do not intend to enter upon an exact Critique of this Piece; the intended
Brevity of this Essay will permit me to take Notice of but some few
Particulars.&mdash;I have no Design or Desire to derogate from the Reputation of
the deceas'd Author; but this I take to be a standing Rule in Critical Writings,
as well as in judicious Reading, that we ought not to be so struck with the
Beauties of an Author, as to be blind to his Failings; nor yet so prejudiced by
his Failings, as to be blind to his Beauties.</p>

<p>The original Design of Characteristic-Writings is to give us real Images of
Life. An exact Imitation of Nature is the chief Art which is to be us'd. The
Imagination, I own, may be allow'd to work in Pieces of this Kind, provided it
keeps within the Degrees of Probability; But Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i> gives us
Characters of Men, who are not to be found in Nature; and, out of a false
Affectation
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<span class = "folionum">F2</span>
of the Wonderful, he carries almost every thing to Excess; represents the
Irregularities of Life as downright Madness, and by his false Colours converts
Men into Monsters.</p>

<p><a name = "tagI" href = "#noteI"><sup>I</sup></a><i>Troilus</i> is a very
supercilious Man: And 'tis no ways inconsistent with this Character to suppose,
that he may entertain a natural Antipathy against an ugly Face, or a bad Voice;
but our Author represents him as labourirg under this Distemper to such a Degree
of Excess, as, I believe, has never been observ'd in any Man. I do not know by
what Name it may be call'd. <i>Troilus</i> conceives an immediate Aversion
against a Person that enters the Room where he is; he shuns him, flies from him,
and will throw himself out at the Window, rather than suffer himself to be
accosted by one, whose Face and Voice he does not like.&mdash;Is this Humour,
or, rather, are not these the genuine Symptoms of Madness and Phrenzy?
And
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
if <i>Troilus</i> does really act after this manner, is he not rather an Object
of Pity, than a Subject for Humour and Ridicule?</p>

<p>The Character of <i>Cleanthes</i>, in the same <a name = "tagK" href =
"#noteK"><sup>K</sup></a>Chapter, is a Misrepresentation of
Nature.&mdash;"<i>Cleanthes</i>
is a very honest Man; he has chosen a Wife, who is the best and the most
reasonable Woman in the World: They, each of them, in their respective Ways,
make up all the Pleasure and Agreeableness of the Company they are in: 'Tis
impossible to meet with more Probity or Politeness. They part to Morrrow, and
the Deed of their Separation is ready drawn up at the Notary's. There are,
certainly, some Kinds of Merit that were never made to be together, and some
Virtues that are incompatible." But those who are endow'd with such good
Qualities, as Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i> ascribes to <i>Cleanthes</i> and his
Wife, can never agree to a willful
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<span class = "folionum">F3</span>
Separation. Nay, 'tis a Contradiction to their Character to suppose that either
of 'em is faln into those Circumstances, which only can make a Separation become
lawful and just. 'Tis true, some Virtues and Accomplishments, as well as some
Vices, may be inconsistent with each other. But to apply this Maxim to the
present Case must betray a great Want of Judgment and Knowledge in the Nature of
Things: For where can one expect to meet with a more perfect Harmony of Virtues,
than in the reciprocal Honesty, Reason and Good-breeding of <i>Cleanthes</i> and
his Wife?</p>

<p>An absent Man often acts out of the Way of common Life, when the Fit of
Absence is upon him; but that this Fit should dwell upon a Man, so long as it
does upon Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i>'s<a name = "tagL"
href = "#noteL"><sup>L</sup></a>
<i>Menalcas</i> I confess, passes my Belief.&mdash;<i>Menalcas</i> rises in the
Morning; and from that Time till he goes to Bed again, he never recovers from
his Fit of Absence:
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
The Distractions of his Mind admit of no Cessation or Interruption: His whole
Life is a continued Series of the greatest Follies. <i>Menalcas</i> is really
never <i>Menalcas</i>; he has no lucid Intervals; he is always another
Man.</p>

<p>If we consult the Operations of our Soul, to discover the proper Causes of
what is call'd <i>Absence of Mind</i>, we shall perceive that the Powers of it
are sometimes contracted within themselves by a Multiplicity of Thought: In
these Cases the inward Exercise of the Soul makes it unable to attend to any
outward Object. But at other Times the Soul wanders from itself; and in these
Cases the Soul being conversant about remote Objects, cannot immediately recover
itself, so as to reflect duly on those which are present. So that this Absence
of the Mind must proceed, either from a Fulness and Intention of Thought, or
from a Want of Reflexion. If it proceeds from a Fulness of Thought, I say 'tis
impossible for the Mind to keep bent so long, as that of <i>Menalcas</i> does:
It must necessarily have some Relaxations. If it proceeds from a Want of
Reflexion,
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<span class = "folionum">F4</span>
it must be confess'd, that he who can live so many Hours without reflecting,
must be either wholly stupid, or some Degrees below the Species of
Mankind.</p>

<p>But what makes the Character of <i>Menalcas</i> still more ridiculous and
unnatural is, that he is stupid and sensible at the same
Time.&mdash;<i>Menalcas</i>
is in the Drawing-Room at Court; and walking very majestically under a Branch of
Candlestics; his Wig is caught up by one of them, and hangs dangling in the Air.
All the Courtiers fall a laughing.&mdash;<i>Menalcas</i> unluckily loses his
Feeling, but still retains the Use of his Ears. He is insensible that his Wig is
taken off his Head; but yet is so happy as to hear the loud Mirth of the
Courtiers, and has still so much good Humour left as to join in Company with
them.&mdash;<i>Menalcas</i> plays at Backgammon.&mdash;He calls for a Glass of
Water; 'tis his Turn to throw; he has the Box in one Hand and the Glass in the
other; and being extremely dry, and unwilling to lose Time, he swallows down
both the Dice and almost the Box, and at the same
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
Time throws the Glass of Water into the Tables.&mdash;If this is not to
overstrain the Bow, to carry Things to an unnatural Excess and Extravagance, and
to make no Distinction between Absence of Mind and Insensibility, or downright
Folly, I confess, I know not what is. <i>Mr. de la Bruyere</i> should have
consider'd, that a Man, who has lost his Feeling, is not, in that Respect, a
proper Subject for Ridicule, and that 'tis no Jest to take away a Man's Senses.
Extravagances of this Nature are no Beauties in any Kind of Writing, much less
in Characteristics. In Performances of this Kind there must be Spirit and
Strength, but especially there must be Justice. The real Images of Life must be
represented, or the Probabilities of Nature must strictly be
observ'd.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">73</span>
The Strokes which compose a Character must be bold, but not extravagant. Nature
must not be distorted, to excite either Ridicule or Admiration. Reason must hold
the Reins of the Imagination: Judgment must direct the Fancy; otherwise we shall
be apt to miscarry, and connect inconsistent Ideas, at the very Time, when we
think we hit the Point of Humour to the Life.</p>

<p>The only Thing that can be said to excuse Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i> on this
Head, is what the Abbot <i>Fleury</i> has alledg'd to his Praise; namely, <a
name = "tagN" href = "#noteN"><sup>N</sup></a>that his Characters are sometimes
loaded, on purpose that they might not too nearly resemble the Persons
design'd.</p>

<p>'Tis very dangerous, I confess, to make free with the Characters of
particular Persons; for there are some Men in the World, who, tho' they are not
asham'd of the Impropriety of their own
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
Manners, yet are they easily offended at the public Notice which is taken of
'em. But tho' Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i> might have very good prudential Reasons
for not making his Characters too particular, yet those Reasons cannot be urg'd,
as a just Plea for his transgressing the Bounds of Characteristic-Justice, by
making his Images unnatural.</p>

<p>In every Kind of Writing there is something of an establish'd Nature which is
essential to it. To deviate from this, is to deviate from Nature it self. Mr.
<i>de la Bruyere</i> is not the only <i>French</i> Man who is guilty in this
Point. Others of his Country-Men have committed much the same Fault in Pastoral
and Comedy. Out of a vain Affectation of saying something very extraordinary and
remarkable, they have departed from the nature of Things: They have given to the
Simplicity of the Country, the Airs of the Town and Court, introduced upon the
Stage Buffoonry and Farce instead of Humour; and by misrepresenting the real
Manners of Men, they have turn'd Nature into Grimace.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">75</span>
The main Beauty of <i>Characteristic-Writings</i> consists in a certain Life and
Spirit, which the Writer ought to endeavour to keep up, by all the Arts which he
is Master of. Nothing will contribute to this more, than the Observance of a
strict Unity in the very Conception of a Character: For Characters are
Descriptions of Persons and Things, as they are such: And, as <a name = "tagO"
href = "#noteO"><sup>O</sup></a>Mr. <i>Budgell</i> has very judiciously
observ'd, "If the Reader is diverted in the midst of a Character, and his
Attention call'd off to any thing foreign to it, the lively Impression it shou'd
have made is quite broken, and it loses more than half its Force." But if this
Doctrine be applied to the Practice of Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i>, it will find
him Guilty. He sometimes runs his Characters to so great a Length, and mixes in
'em so many Particulars and unnecessary Circumstances, that they justly deserve
the Name, rather of Histories than Characters.&mdash;Such
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
is the <a name = "tagP" href = "#noteP"><sup>P</sup></a>Article concerning
<i>Emira</i>. 'Tis an artful Description of a Woman's Vanity, in pretending to
be insensible to the Power of Love, merely because she has never been exposed to
the Charms of a lovely Person; and there is nothing in this Character, but what
is agreeable to Nature, and carried on with a great deal of Humour. But the many
Particulars which Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i> has drawn into the Composition of it,
and which, in Truth, are not essential to the main Design, have quite chang'd
the Nature of the Character, and converted it into a History, or rather a little
Romance.&mdash;'Tis true, Histories are Pictures as well as Characters; but yet
there will ever be as wide a Difference between 'em, as there is between a
Picture at full Length, and one in Miniature.</p>

<p>The <a name = "tagQ" href = "#noteQ"><sup>Q</sup></a>Characters of
<i>Giton</i> and <i>Phebon</i> are humorous enough. And they are allow'd to be
kept within the just Bounds of Probability. But Mr. <i>de la
Bruyere</i>
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
has heap'd up so many Particulars and unnecessary Circumstances, which do not
convey any new Ideas, that the Characters grow languid
and tedious.&mdash;<i>Giton</i>
is respected; every thing that he says or does is approved of. <i>Phebon</i> is
despis'd; no Notice is taken of what he says or does. The Reason of this
Difference is not so mysterious, but that it may be told in less than two or
three Pages. <i>Giton</i> is rich, and <i>Phebon</i> is poor.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is such a Confusion in Mr. <i>de la Bruyere's</i> Designs,
that one cannot easily discover whether he intended to draw the Character of a
particular Person, or to make a Picture of some prevailing Vice, or only a moral
Reflexion.&mdash;Such is the <a name = "tagR"
href = "#noteR"><sup>R</sup></a>Article
of <i>Zenobia</i>. Was it design'd for the Character of <i>Zenobia</i>? But 'tis
rather a Description of the Magnificence, and beautiful Situation of the Palace,
which she was then building. Or was it design'd to censure and lash the
Publicans of the
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
Age, for the Extortions which they practis'd, and the immense Riches which they
amass'd by Fraud and Oppression? But this Satir comes in only by the by, and in
a very <ins class = "correction" title = "original reads 'j june'">jejune</ins>
Manner. Or lastly, was it intended only for a moral Reflexion on the sudden
Revolutions and Vicissitudes of Fortune? But the Length of this Article is
inconsistent with the nature of a Reflexion; and if any thing like this was
intended, it must come in as the <span class = "greek">epimuthion</span>, the
Moral of the Fable; which will make the Contents of this Article, still more
different from the nature of a Character, than any thing that has yet been
mentioned.</p>

<p>'Tis not enough that a Character be drawn conformable to that Existence which
it really has, or probably may have in Nature: It must further be cloath'd in
proper Sentiments, and express'd in a simple and natural Style. But Mr. <i>de la
Bruyere</i>, consider'd as a Writer of Characters, is too affected in his way of
Thinking, and too artificial in the Turn of his Expressions.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">79</span>
The previous Apology which he made for himself in this Point, is so far from the
Purpose, that nothing is more so.</p>

<blockquote>
Recollecting, <a name = "tagS" href = "#noteS"><sup>S</sup></a>says he, that
amongst the Writings ascrib'd to <i>Theophrastus</i> by <i>Diogenes
Laertius</i>, there is one which bears the Title of <i>Proverbs</i>, i.e. of
loose unconnected Observations, and that the most considerable Book of Morality,
that ever was made, bears that Name in the sacred Writings; we have been excited
by such great Examples to imitate, according to our Capacity, a like Way of
Writing concerning Manners.
</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;'Tis true, that in the Catalogue of <i>Theophrastus </i> his Works,
preserv'd by <a name = "tagT" href = "#noteT"><sup>T</sup></a><i>Diogenes
Laertius</i>, there is one Book under the Title <span class = "greek">peri
paroimiôn</span> concerning <i>Proverbs</i>: But that, probably, was nothing but
a Collection of some of those short, remarkable, useful, pithy Sayings, which
are of common Use in the World, and which every Nation has peculiar to
it
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
self. However, tho' we cannot exactly tell, what the Nature of that Performance
was, because the Book is now lost, yet we are certain, on the other Hand, that
the Design of <i>Solomon</i> was not to write Characters, but to deliver some
Maxims of Morality by way of Advice and Instruction. So that for a profess'd
Writer of Characters, to take a Book of <i>Proverbs</i> for a Model, is as
inconsistent, as if any one, who intended to compose an Oration, shou'd form his
Diction upon a Poem. <i>Proverbs</i> consist of short Sentences, which contain
in themselves a full and compleat Sense; and therefore they do not essentially
require a strict Relation and Correspondence; but <i>Characteristic-Writings</i>
do require such a strict Relation and Correspondence. And Mr. <i>de la
Bruyere</i> is so faulty in this Point, that almost every where he has no
visible Connexion.&mdash;<i>Characteristic-Writings</i> ought, I own, to have a
lively Turn, and a Laconic Air: but there is a wide Difference between using a
concise Manner, and writing as many Aphorisms as Sentences.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<span class = "folionum">G</span>
How far Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i> is defective as to Propriety of Style and
Justness of Expression, I chuse to set down in the Words of one of his <a name =
"tagV" href = "#noteV"><sup>V</sup></a>Countrymen, a very judicious Writer, and
a better Judge in this Matter than I pretend to be. "Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i>,
qui n'a point de Style formé, ecrivant au hazard, employe des Expressions
outrées en des Choses tres communes; &amp; quand il en veut dire de plus
relevées, il les affoiblit par des Expressions basses, &amp; fait ramper le fort
avec le foible. Il tend sans relache a un sublime qu'il ne connoit pas, &amp;
qu'il met tantot dans les choses, tantot dans les Paroles, sans jamais attraper
le Point d'Unité, qui concilie les Paroles avec les choses, en quoi consiste
tout le Secret, &amp; la Finesse de cette Art merveilleux."&mdash;This is the
Censure which an ingenious Author, under the feign'd Name of <i>Vigneul
Marville</i>, has pass'd upon Mr. <i>de la</i>
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
<i>Bruyere's</i> Style. However, I think my self oblig'd in Justice to inform
the Reader, that Mr. <i>Coste</i>, in his Defence of Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i>,
has endeavour'd to prove that this Censure is ill grounded. But I will not
pretend to decide in a Case of this Nature. Matters relating to Style are the
nicest Points in Learning: The greatest Men have grosly err'd on this Subject. I
only declare my own Opinion on the Matter, that Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i>'s Style
appears to me forc'd, affected, and improper for Characteristic Writings.
Several ingenious <i>French</i> Gentlemen, who have themselves writ with
Applause in this Language, entertain the same Sentiments, and have ingenuously
confess'd to me, that they could never read ten Pages together of Mr. <i>de la
Bruyere</i>, without feeling such an Uneasiness and Pain, as arises from a
continued Affectation and a perpetual Constraint. But the Reader is still left
free. To form a right Judgment on Correctness is an easy Matter by the ordinary
Rules of Grammar, but to do the same concerning the Turn and Air, and peculiar
Beauties of Style,
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<span class = "folionum">G2</span>
depends on a particular Taste: They are not capable of being prov'd to those who
have not this Taste, but to those who have it, they are immediately made
sensible by a bare pointing out.</p>

<p>The running Title which Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i> has given to his Book does,
by no Means, square with the several Parts of it. With Relation to my present
Purpose I observe, that, strictly speaking, this Performance is, but in Part, of
the Characteristic-Kind. The Characters, which are interspers'd in it, being
reducible to a very narrow Compass, and the main Body of it consisting of
miscellaneous Reflexions. And these are not confin'd, as is pretended, only to
the present Age, but extend themselves both to past and present Times. So that
if Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i> had, with his View, chosen another Title for his
Book, tho' it wou'd not have been so uncommon, yet wou'd it have been more
proper than the present Title; and the Performance it self wou'd then, in some
Measure, have
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
less deserv'd Censure.</p>

<p>Tho' Mr. <i>de la Bruyere's</i> Work is not perfect in that Kind, in which it
is pretended to excel, it must nevertheless be confess'd, that it has many
Beauties and Excellencies. To deny this, wou'd be an Affront to the Judgment of
the Gentlemen of the <i>French</i> Academy: But yet our Complaisance ought not,
cannot go so far, as to prejudice our own Judgment. We cannot think, as <a name
= "tagX" href = "#noteX"><sup>X</sup></a>some of 'em did, that Mr. <i>de la
Bruyere</i> has excell'd <i>Theophrastus</i>, the great Original which he
propos'd to himself. Mr. <i>de la Bruyere</i> had a more modest Opinion of
himself: He wou'd have been proud of the Title of <i>little Theophrastus</i>.
And in Truth, it deserves no small Share of Praise, to come up to
<i>Theophrastus</i> in any Degree of Comparison.&mdash;If then Mr. <i>de la
Bruyere</i> has committed some Faults, 'tis nothing but what others have done,
both before
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
and since him: But if he has, as I have already allow'd him to have, some
considerable Beauties; 'tis more than a great many other Authors have, tho' of
greater Bulk: And these Excellencies ought in Justice to be admitted as some
Excuse for those Defects.</p>

<p>'Tis true Mr. <i>de la Rochefoucault</i>'s Design was too general, and his

he did

not professedly write Characters, <ins class = "correction"
title = "original reads 'ye  this Work'">yet this Work</ins>
shews that he was very able to do it;
and it may be of very great Service to those, who wou'd attempt any thing in
this Kind.</p>

<p>I have often wonder'd that no <i>English</i> Writer has ever professedly
attempted a Performance in the Characteristic-Way. I mean, such a profess'd
Performance, as wou'd extend it self to the different Conditions of Men, and
describe the various Ends which they propose to themselves in Life; as wou'd
take in the chief Branches of Morality and Behaviour, and, in some Measure, make
a compleat Work: For as to loose Attempts and Sketches in this Kind, there are
many Years since we had some; the most considerable of which, I mean of those
that bear the Title of Characters, are printed together with Sir <i>Thomas
Overbury</i>'s <span class = "smallcaps">Wife</span>. These are said to have
been written, partly by that unfortunate Knight, and partly by some of his
Friends. And if the Editor had not taken Care to give us this Notice, yet still
that great Disparity which appears but too
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
visibly in them, wou'd manifestly prove that they were compos'd by very
different Hands.&mdash; There are, I confess, many good Things to be met with in
these Characters, but they are very far from making a compleat Work: And really
this was not intended. Besides, nothing can possibly be more contrary to the
Nature of <i>Characteristic-Writings</i>, than the corrupted Taste which
prevail'd in the Age. A continued Affectation of far-fetch'd and quaint
Simile's, which runs thro' almost all these Characters, makes 'em appear like so
many Pieces of mere Grotesque; and the Reader must not expect to find Persons
describ'd as they really are, but rather according to what they are thought to
be like.</p>

<p>This Censure may be thought hard; but yet it leaves Room for some Exceptions:
And that I may do Justice to Merit, where it is really due, I shall here set
down one of those Characters, which seem'd to me to be exquisite in its Kind.
And this I shall the rather do, because the Book it self is not in
every

Nature in its greatest Simplicity, and 'tis the more beautiful because 'tis

<p>What makes me wonder that no <i>English</i> Writer has ever attempted
a
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
profess'd Performance in the <i>Characteristic-Way</i> is, that we are,
certainly, more able to undertake a Work of this Nature than any other Nation;
because our Countrymen afford a greater Variety of Subject Matter than any other
People.&mdash;Human Nature, as I observ'd before, in its various Forms and
Affections, is the Subject of <i>Characteristic-Writings</i>: And from this
Diversity of Manners arises that, which is properly call'd <i>Humour</i>, and
which, upon a double Account, seems to be peculiar to our Nation; not only
because there is no Word in any other Language so expressive, but also because
there is no Nation, in which we can find a greater Variety of original
<i>Humour</i>, than amongst the <i>English</i>. Sir <i>William Temple</i>,
speaking of the Dramatic Performances of the Stage, expresses himself after the
following Manner.&mdash;<a name = "tagZ" href = "#noteZ"><sup>Z</sup></a></p>

<blockquote>
In this the <i>Italian</i>, the <i>Spanish</i>, and the <i>French</i>, have all
had their different Merit, and receiv'd
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
their just Applauses. Yet I am deceiv'd, if our <i>English</i> has not in some
Kind excell'd both the Modern and the Antient; which has been by Force of a
Vein, natural perhaps to our Country, and which with us is call'd <i>Humour</i>,
a Word peculiar to our Language too, and hard to be express'd in any other; nor
is it (that I know of) found in any Foreign Writers, unless it be
<i>Moliere</i>, and yet his it self has too much of the Farce, to pass for the
same with ours. <i>Shakespear</i> was the first that opened this Vein upon our
Stage, which has run so freely and so pleasantly ever since, that I have often
wonder'd to find it appear so little upon any others; being a Subject so proper
for them, since <i>Humour</i> is but a Picture of particular Life, as Comedy is
of general; and tho' it represents Dispositions and Customs less common, yet
they are not less natural than those that are more frequent among
Men.
</blockquote>

<p><i>Humour</i> is the only genuine Source of all that agreeable Variety of
original Characters, which is so entertaining to
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
a Spectator and Reader: And Sir <i>William Temple</i> proceeds to observe, that
in this Point the Moderns in general, and the <i>English</i> in particular, have
far excell'd the Antients. This Observation is very just, however partial it may
seem to a Foreigner, and the Reason of it is very obvious. I shall represent 'em
both in Sir <i>William</i>'s own Words. The Passage is somewhat long, but the
Goodness of it will amply pay the Reader for his Trouble in perusing
it.</p>

<blockquote>
It may seem a Defect (says he) in the antient Stage, that the Characters
introduc'd were so few, and those so common, as a covetous old Man, an amorous
young, a witty Wench, a crafty Slave, a bragging Soldier. The Spectators met
nothing upon the Stage, but what they met in the Streets, and at every Turn. All
the Variety is drawn only from different and uncommon Events; whereas if the
Characters are so too, the Diversity and the Pleasure must needs be the more.
But as of most general Customs in a Country, there is usually some Ground, from
the Nature of the
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
People or Climat, so there may be amongst us for this Vein of our Stage, and a
greater Variety of <i>Humour</i> in the Picture, because there is a greater
Variety in the Life. This may proceed from the native Plenty of our Soil, the
Unequalness of our Climat, as well as the Ease of our Government, and the
Liberty of professing Opinions and Factions, which perhaps our Neighbours may
have about them, but are forc'd to disguise, and thereby they may come in Time
to be extinguish'd. Plenty begets Wantonness and Pride, Wantonness is apt to
invent, and Pride scorns to imitate; Liberty begets Stomach or Heart, and
Stomach will not be constrain'd. Thus we come to have more Originals, and more
that appear what they are; we have more <i>Humour</i>, because every Man follows
his own, and takes a Pleasure, perhaps a Pride, to shew it.

<span class = "folionum">H</span>
of the Characters which they exhibited; and in this they have receiv'd just
Applauses: But yet they did not exhaust the Spring from whence they drew: The
ingenious Mr. <i>Congreve</i> has pursu'd the same Vein of <i>Humour</i>; and he
has imitated his Predecessors so well, that he has by far out-done 'em all. In
his Dramatic-Pieces there is the greatest Variety of <i>Humour</i> and of
original Characters, set off by the greatest Delicacy of Sentiments, and adorn'd
with the Beauties of the justest Diction that can possibly be imagined. Mr.
<i>Dryden</i> must be allow'd to be a competent Judge in an Affair of this
Nature, and he has given us the true Character and Panegyric of Mr.
<i>Congreve</i> in the following Lines.</p>

<div class = "verse">
In him all Beauties of this Age we see;<br>
<i>Etherege</i> his Courtship, <i>Southern</i>'s Purity;<br>
The Satir, Wit and Strength of manly <i>Wicherly</i>.
</div>

<p>'Tis true, there is some Difference between the Characters which enter
into
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
the Composition of Dramatic Pieces, and those which are represented by
<i>Characteristic-Writers</i>; but this Difference is so small, that I doubt not
but he, who is an able Master in one of these Kinds, would as successfully
perform in the other. For, in reality, the essential Parts of the Characters, in
the <i>Drama</i>, and in <i>Characteristic-Writings</i>, are the same. They are
both an Image of one Life; a Representation of one Person: All the Diversity
lies in the different Manner of representing the same Image. The <i>Drama</i>
presents to the Eyes of a Spectator an Actor, who speaks and acts as the Person,
whom he represents, is suppos'd to speak and act in real Life. The
<i>Characteristic</i> Writer introduces, in a descriptive manner, before a
Reader, the same Person, as speaking and acting in the same manner: And both
must be perform'd in such a natural and lively manner, as may deceive the
Spectator and Reader, and make them fancy they see the Person represented or
characteris'd.</p>

<p>But tho' no <i>English</i> Author has attempted a Performance in this Kind,
yet it
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
must be confess'd that in some late diurnal Papers we have had excellent
Specimens in the Characteristic-Way. The Papers, which I mean to point out, are
the <i>Tatlers</i> and the <i>Spectators</i>. They are of the miscellaneous
Kind, and were design'd for the universal Delight and Instruction of the
<i>British</i> Nation. In these Papers are contained Abundance of true Wit and
<i>Humour</i>, lively Descriptions of human Nature in its various Forms and
Disguises, the Praises of Virtue, and pointed Satir against Vice; and here and
there are interspers'd Characters of Men and Manners compleatly drawn to the
Life.&mdash;If the great Authors, who were concerned in the Composition of those
Papers, would have join'd their Abilities to form a Work of this Kind, I doubt
not but it would have been inimitable, and deserv'd the next Place, in Point of
Fame, to that of <i>Theophrastus</i>: For this is the highest Pitch to which
Moderns can aspire. A greater Design would be Presumption, and would only serve
to shew the greater Vanity of the Attempt. An establish'd
<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
Reputation of above two thousand Years cannot be easily shaken.
<i>Theophrastus</i> is, and ever will be, an Original
in <i>Characteristic-Writings</i>.
His Fame still lives in our Memory, and the Main of his Characters still
subsists in our Actions.
